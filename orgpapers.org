* Introduction

** Will this guide be useful for you?

This guide will be useful for you if you are writing a research paper,
a dissertation or an academic book. It would be particularly useful if
you plan to present statistical analysis and need to cite existing
literature in your work. 

Following this guide would need some investment of time. But this
would help you document your research in a way that is reproducible.
It will help you focus on the content of research and, once you have
specified your style, leave all formatting of your document to the
software. It will facilitate building a personal bibliographic
repository and repeated use of bibliographic information for citation
of literature.

In sum, if academic writing is going to be a medium to long-term
occupation for you, this investment of time is going to be
particularly beneficial.

** What is our goal?

After following instructions in this guide, you will have a document
preparation system that has following features.

+ With easy style specifications that you provide, the document will
  be almost-entirely automatically formatted by the software.

  - Complicated latex-style markup is a pain and Openoffice/MS-Word
    documents require too much manual formatting.
    
  - Org-mode has a powerful latex converter. The user is not required
    to write latex mark-up. Org-mode mark-up is extremely simple, and
    can be mastered in ten minutes.

  - Org-mode automatically creates latex files, and produces fully
    formatted pdf documents. This is the best output for working
    papers, reports and dissertations. Some journals also accept latex
    files, though this is rare among social science journals.

  - Org-mode also has a good openoffice exporter. With an appropriate
    openoffice template file, you can get a fully formatted openoffice
    or MS-Word output.

  - Org-mode can also produce html files. By specifying appropriate
    css classes, you can obtain ready to publish html files for your
    website. Org-mode can be hooked to publish to your blog.

+ Instead of including statistical results (tables, graphs, etc), we
  would embed appropriate R programs in the document, so that when the
  formatted output is produced, all programs are run to generate the
  results. Advantages of doing this are:
  - Any changes in the data being used can be accommodated just by
    publishing the document again.
  - Any modifications in statistical analysis are easily made by
    modifying the programs that are embedded in the file itself.
  - Anyone who has the org file, can reproduce your results. You can
    also extract all R programs from the org file and distribute those
    for reproduction of your results.

+ The document will be integrated with a citation manager, so that
  bibliographic information will be pulled automatically from a
  central database.
  - You will maintain a bibliographic database in bibtex format, that
    you can build over time, adding bibliographic information for
    works that you cite. 
  - Many websites (including Google Scholar) provide bibliographic
    information directly in bibtex format, and we will have integrated
    tools that will allow us to pull this information directly into
    our local database.
  - A fully formatted bibliography will be created for all documents
    cited in your papers and included in the paper when a final output
    is produced.

* Installing necessary software
This set up will work with any operating system (linux, Mac OS-X, or
Windows).

You need to install the following
+ Emacs 
  + With org-mode, ess
+ Texlive
+ R

* Basics of Emacs

GNU Emacs is an extensible platform. Although its primary function is
as an editor, it can be extended to do almost anything that you would
want your computer to do. Now, that really is not an overstatement. It
is a worthwhile aim to slowly shift an increasing number of tasks you
do on your computer to emacs-based solutions. For each major task you
do on your computer, ask if it can be done using emacs. For almost
everything, the answer is yes, and in most cases, emacs does it better
than other software you are used to. Many emacs users have learnt
emacs by shifting, one-by-one, to emacs for all major tasks that they
do on the computer.

I am not going to give a detailed guide to use of emacs. A few tasks
for which I use Emacs include
 + File management (copying files, moving files, creating directories)
 + Reading and writing e-mails
 + Reading RSS feeds
 + Calender, scheduler, planner
 + Calculator
 + Statistical work (by hooking Emacs to R)
 + And, of course, as an editor (including for writing research papers)

For the present purpose, I will just make you familiar with basic
commands in emacs. 

** Notations

In emacs, a buffer is equivalent to a tab in a web browser. It is
normal to have several buffers open at the same time. Each file opens
in emacs as a buffer. Buffers could also have processes like R running
in them. Emacs displays any messages for you in a separate buffer.

Most commands in emacs are given using the Control (ctrl) or the Meta
(usually, alt) keys. Control key is usually referred to as =C-= and the
Meta key as =M-=. So a command =C-c= means pressing Control and c
simultaneously. Command =M-x= means pressing Meta and x simultaneously.
Everything is case-sensitive. So =M-X= would mean, pressing Meta, Shift
and x simultaneously. =C-c M-x l= would mean pressing C-c, release, then
M-x, release, and then l.


** Basic commands

Table [[essential-emacs-commands]] gives the commands that are the most
important. This is a minimal set, commands that you should aim to
learn as soon as possible. There are many more, which you will learn
as you start using emacs.

All commands have a verbose version that can be used by pressing M-x
and writing the command. For example, =M-x find-file= to open a file.
All major commands are also mapped to a shortcut. For example, instead
of typing =M-x find-file= to open a file, you can say =C-x C-f=. I
remember shortcuts for commands that I use most frequently. For
others, I use the verbose versions. Over time, one learns more
shortcuts and starts using them instead of the verbose versions.

* Basics of Org-mode
** Sections and headlines

A headline in org starts with one or more stars (*) followed by a
space. We shall use this to create sections in our document. 

For the main sections, we use the top-level headlines created by using
a single star. For sub-sections, we use second-level headline.
Second-level headlines start with two stars. Third level headlines
start with three stars. You can create as many levels of sections as
you need. 

See the following example. Note that headlines are not numbered. We
leave section numbering for org-mode to handle automatically.

Org handles these headlines beautifully. With your cursor on the
headline, pressing tab folds-in the contents of a headline. If you
press tab on a folded headline, it opens to display the contents. If
there are multiple levels of headlines, these open in stages as you
repeat pressing the tab key.

When you are on a headline, pressing M-return creates a new headline
at the same level (that is, with the same number of stars). Once you
are on the new headline, a tab movies it to a lower level (that is, a
star is added), and shift-tab moves it to a higher level (that is, a
star is removed).

(Further reading, [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Headlines.html#Headlines][Headlines]] in Org manual)

** Lists

** Tables

Org-mode has an in-built table editor, which is very simple to use.

We shall directly create only those tables in Org that present content
that is not being produced through statistical analysis. For tables
that are created through statistical analysis, we shall embed R
programs rather than the tables themselves. This is discussed in
Section [[Org-mode and R]] of this guide.

See the Org syntax for a sample table below.

: | Serial no | Name   | Age |
: |-----------+--------+-----|
: |         1 | Satish |  43 |
: |         2 | Ramesh |  21 |
: |         3 | Alicia |  42 |
: |         4 | Begum  |  52 |

+ Org-mode creates tables by separating columns using  |.
+ Once you create the first row by separating columns using |,
  pressing tabs takes you from the first column to the next.
+ At the end of the row, pressing tab again, creates a new blank row.
  You can also create a new blank row by pressing return anywhere in
  the last row.
+ For creating a horizontal line anywhere, type |- at the starting of
  the line, and press tab. 
+ Contents of each cell are aligned automatically by Org.
+ To delete a row, use C-k (M-x kill-line).

Org provides various commands for manipulating design of tables. Table
[[org-table-commands]] provides the most important ones. Note that Table
[[org-table-commands]] is created using Org mode. It also gives you an
idea of how the table would look eventually.

#+NAME: org-table-commands
#+CAPTION: Commands to manipulate tables in Org
| Command     | Description                                            |
|-------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| M-<left>    | Move the column left                                   |
| M-<right>   | Move the column right                                  |
| M-S-<left>  | Delete the current column                              |
| M-S-<right> | Insert a new column to the left of the cursor position |
| M-<up>      | Move row up                                            |
| M-<down>    | Move row down                                          |
| M-S-<up>    | Delete the current row or horizontal line              |
| M-S-<down>  | Insert a new row above the current row                 |

For more commands for manipulating tables, see [[http://www.orgmode.org/manual/Tables.html][this section of the Org
manual]]. In particular, you may want to look at spreadsheet-like
functions of the table editor.

** Images

You can insert images in documents as follows

: [[a.jpg]]

Once again, graphs produced by R, will be inserted automatically.

** Captions and cross-references

As shown below, a line starting by #+CAPTION adds a title to Tables or
images. All Tables and Figures will be automatically numbered. 
: #+CAPTION: Percentage of literate men and women, by country (per cent)

For referring to these Tables and Figures in the text, we shall name
each table and figure in a line starting with #+NAME as below.

: #+NAME: literacy-rate

Finally, an image will be inserted as follows.
: #+NAME: literacy-rate
: #+CAPTION: Percentage of literate men and women, by country (per cent)
: [[a.jpg]]

Similarly, a table will be inserted as follows.

: #+NAME: literacy-rate-table
: #+CAPTION: Percentage of literate men and women, by country (per cent)
: | Country    | Men | Women |
: | India      |  75 |    43 |
: | Bangladesh |  83 |    63 |
: | Rwanda     |  77 |    60 |

To refer to the Table above in the text, write Table [ [
literacy-rate-table ] ], that is, enclose table name between double
square brackets. When the formatted output is produced, it would be
automatically converted to the appropriate number.

All objects with captions are numbered, and cross-references to these
named objects, are converted to these numbers. If new objects are
inserted in the paper, numbering will be adjusted automatically.
